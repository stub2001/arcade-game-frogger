# Frogger style arcade game

This is a simple arcade game that is built on pure Javascript using mostly Object oriented principles.


## Installation

Clone a copy of the game:

`git clone https://github.com/stub2001/arcade-game-frogger.git`

Then navigate to the `index.html` file in the top level of the file structure 

Open it in an up-to-date browser. The game should start working.

## How to play

The aim of the game is to get your player from the grass to the water safely without getting hit by the bugs on the path. You can use your keyboards up, down, left and right keys to direct your character around the game.

The more times you succeed, the faster the bugs will come for you.
